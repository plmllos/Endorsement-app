# Endorsement app

JavaScript challenge from Scrimba

Original challenge is with database using Firebase - that will be my next challange after I master more JS. 

HTML, CSS and JS all done from scratch following UI design from Figma.

Room for improvment - Increment likes feature should be different, now it's just hard-coded manipulating with DOM.
